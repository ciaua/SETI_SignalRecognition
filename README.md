This project was conducted in partnership with SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute. A detailed report of the findings can be found at: http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1143/1/FanSmithWang_CS341.pdf

We have included scripts for both data extraction and analysis. Most notable is the dynamic programming algorithm that converts spectrogram images into discrete time series datapoints (scripts/extraction/path_tracer.cpp).

The project has dependency on OpenCV (C++): opencv.org
